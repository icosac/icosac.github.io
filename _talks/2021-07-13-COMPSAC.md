In this work, we introduce a GPU-parallel implementation of the [Iterative Dynamic Programming (IDP)](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2020.2972787) algorithm for solving the multi-point Markov–Dubins problem, which seeks the shortest bounded-curvature path through several waypoints. Unlike traditional optimization methods (NLP/MINLP), this approach is inherently parallelizable and significantly improves accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency, making it well suited for embedded and real-time applications.
