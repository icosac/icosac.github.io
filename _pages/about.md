I’m Enrico Saccon, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy — which basically means I spend more time convincing robots to do things, rather than deciding what to cook for dinner. I'm part of the [Interdipartimental Robotics Lab (IDRA-lab)](http://github.com/idra-lab), fusing computer scientists, roboticists and engineers.

My research lives at the intersection of AI, robotics, and knowledge representation. I’m particularly interested in how symbolic reasoning and machine learning can team up to make autonomous systems a little less confused about the world (and maybe even helpful).

I’m the developer of [PLANTOR](https://github.com/idra-lab/plantor) — a framework that uses Large Language Models to generate structured knowledge bases, plan for multi-robot systems, and produce behavior trees for actual execution. Think of it as giving robots both a brain and a plan (and hoping they don’t unionize).

I also work on automatically generating [Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)](https://www.github.com/idra-lab/prolog_mdp) from symbolic knowledge, using reachability analysis to make sure our agents don’t wander into logical black holes.

Outside of research, rather than finding balance between robots and planning, I enjoy finding balance when climbing or spending time outdoors and around the world.

📍 Usually in Trento, sometimes in Germany, always in front of a terminal. 

📍 Currently at [DLR](https://www.dlr.de/) in Munich.

I can’t _legally_ send it to you — but let’s just say I’m happy to _discuss_ about it.
